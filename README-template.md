## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="button-container">
  <button id="add-button">
    <img src="./images/icon-cart.svg" alt="Picture of shopping cart" />
    <p>Add to Cart</p>
  </button>
</div>

This is how I made the button have an image and text inside of it.
```

```css
@font-face {
        font-family: "FrauncesStyle";
        src: url("./fonts/Fraunces/Fraunces-VariableFont_SOFT,WONK,opsz,wght.ttf");
}

      @font-face {
        font-family: "MontserratStyle";
        src: url("./fonts/Montserrat/Montserrat-VariableFont_wght.tff");
}

#discount-price {
        color: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
        font-family: "FrauncesStyle";
        font-size: 2rem;
        font-weight: bold;
}

This is how I imported variable font and was able to mess with some of its settings.
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

\*Things I want to focus on in future projects is messing with variable fonts. They seem like a cool way to set up a unique experience.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_fonts/Variable_fonts_guide) - This helped me understand variable fonts a bit more and how to set them up.
